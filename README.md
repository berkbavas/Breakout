# Breakout

Continuous collision detection algorithm between circle and line segment written in `Java 11`.

Logic can be found in the classes under ``com.github.berkbavas.breakout.math``
and ``com.github.berkbavas.breakout.physics.simulator``.

The project can be built and run with ``Maven``.

There are two entry points; ``Debugger.java`` is for debugging purposes
and ``Breakout.java`` is an application of the algorithm.
